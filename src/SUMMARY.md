# Summary

Various projects I've done, or plan to do around the house.

See `/src` for markdown files.

This isn't really meant as a step-by-step guide to any of these projects. Primarily for my own reference, but I'd like it to read as a blog of sorts, including some lessons learned for future me to refer to.
