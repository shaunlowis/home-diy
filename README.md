# home-diy

Various projects I've done, or plan to do around the house.

## Overview

This isn't really meant as a step-by-step guide to any of these projects, as I don't want to put the effort in for that. Please feel free to reach out and request more steps (via an issue) if you happen across this repo.

Primarily this is for my own reference, but I'd like it to read as a blog of sorts, including some lessons learned for future me to refer to.
