# Custom watch

## Background/Motivation

I quite like fossil watches. I don't like their prices. Let's make one from Ali Express parts and assemble it.

Watch I'd like to emulate is [here](https://www.fossil.com/en-us/products/townsman-automatic-brown-leather-watch/ME3267.html). See images named inspo_*

So, this sums to:

- I'd like a face that shows the gears.
- A self winding watch would be great.
- I prefer a round body.
- I prefer a leather strap.
